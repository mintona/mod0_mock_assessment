flower_status (boolean)
current_leaf_size (integer)
maximum_leaf_size (integer)

minimum_water_requirement (boolean)
shape (string)

Methods:
prune_plant (changes the shape and reduces current_plant_height )
grow (references the minimum_water_requirement and light_requirement and if fulfilled, the current_leaf_size and current_plant_height will change until they reach maximum_leaf_size and maximum_plant_height)
water_plant (references minimum_water_requirement and adds water if needed)
open_flower (if the plant has a flower true, open_flower changes the flower_status to true if light_requirement is met and if not, flower_status stays false)
